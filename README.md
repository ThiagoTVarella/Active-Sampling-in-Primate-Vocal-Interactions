# Active Sampling in Primate Vocal Interactions

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the paper titled "Active Sampling in Primate Vocal Interactions". This repository contains the necessary code and data to reproduce the figures and understand the implementation of the Expected Information Density (EID) and the active sampling model discussed in the paper.

## Files

1. **ActiveSamplingFigures.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code required to generate the figures presented in the paper. The code in this notebook utilizes the data provided in the `data.npz` file to create the figures in the paper.

2. **data.npz**: This data file is a key component for reproducing the figures in the paper. It includes the dataset for generating the visual representations. The data file is utilized by the `ActiveSamplingFigures.ipynb` notebook.
2a. ** data3.npz**: This data file includes some extra data that can be used to reproduce the figures from the peer-reviewed version of the paper.

3. **ActiveSamplingSimulation.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook goes beyond the content of the paper and provides additional figures, explanations, and details regarding the implementation of the Expected Information Density and the active sampling model. It can serve as a resource for those who want a deeper understanding of the methodologies and techniques employed in the study.

## Reproducing the Figures

To reproduce the figures presented in the paper, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed along with the required libraries imported in the first cell of the notebooks.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `ActiveSamplingFigures.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to generate the figures.

## Understanding the Expected Information Density (EID) and Active Sampling Model

For a more comprehensive understanding of the EID and the active sampling model, you can refer to the `ActiveSamplingSimulation.ipynb` notebook. This notebook provides additional insights, explanations, and figures that can help clarify the implementation details discussed in the paper.
